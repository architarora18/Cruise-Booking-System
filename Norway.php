            <h1>Norway</h1>
           Norway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the 
           Scandinavian Peninsula; the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of
           Svalbard are also part of the Kingdom of Norway.From the Middle Ages to 1814 Norway was part of the
           Danish kingdom. Norwegian possessions in the North Atlantic, Faroe Islands, Greenland,
           and Iceland, remained Danish when Norway was passed to Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel.
           Norway also comprised Bohuslän until 1658, Jämtland and Härjedalen until 1645, Shetland 
           and Orkney until 1468, and the Hebrides and Isle of Man until the Treaty of Perth in 1266.
