            <h1>Mexico</h1>
           Mexico is located between latitudes 14째 and 33째N, and longitudes 86째 and 119째W in the southern
           portion of North America. Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American Plate, with small 
           parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some 
           geographers include the territory east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total)
           within Central America. Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North 
           America, along with Canada and the United States.
