           Like most Danish cities, the origins of Koge precede written history. 
           Koge was first recognized as an official market town in 1288, as a contrast to the ecclesiastical
           center at that time – Roskilde, and was an important merchant town during the late Middle Ages.During 
           the local witchhunt, called Koge Huskors (1608–1615), at least 15 people were convicted of
           witchcraft and burned at the stake. Koge suffered during the wars between Denmark and Sweden
           (1643–1720, → Battle of Koge Bay). In 1807, the town and surrounding area was the scene of the 
           Battle of Koge between British and Danish troops. Koge remained a small town until the late 19th century,
           when industrial development and population growth began. Today, Koge form the core of the 18th largest urban area in Denmark.
